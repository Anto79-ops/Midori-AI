## Meet Luna Midori, the Creator and Operator

Hey Cuties! I'm Luna Midori, the brains behind Midori AI and a passionate streamer who loves fostering a safe and welcoming online community.

Before transitioning to Twitch, I was a YouTuber for eight years, honing my skills in content creation and building communities. My primary drive as a streamer isn't about numbers or income; it's about cultivating a haven where everyone feels comfortable, accepted, and entertained.

My main focus has shifted from Final Fantasy XIV to Honkai: Star Rail, a game that has captivated me since its release. I'm passionate about helping others both within and outside of the game.

While I stream regularly, life sometimes throws curveballs. I also love exploring the potential of VR through my full-body setup, further enhancing immersion and interactions.

I'm excited to integrate AI elements into my streaming experiences to create engaging and interactive content for my viewers. If you're seeking companionship and support, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new connections and sharing my adventures with you.

Thank you for being a part of my journey!

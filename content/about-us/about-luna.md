Hey there! I'm Luna Midori, the one who brings Midori AI to life, and I'm also an enthusiastic streamer who enjoys nurturing safe and inviting online communities.

Before joining Twitch, I spent eight wonderful years on  YouTube, constantly refining my skills in content creation and building strong communities. My true passion as a streamer is not driven by numbers or income; instead, it revolves around creating a space where everyone feels comfortable, accepted, and entertained.

Recently, I've shifted my focus from Final Fantasy XIV to Honkai: Star Rail, a game that has completely captured my attention since its release. I'm dedicated to helping others, both inside and outside the game, to make the most of their experiences.

Additionally, I'm thrilled to incorporate AI elements into my streaming sessions, with the aim of crafting engaging and interactive content for my cherished viewers. If you're seeking companionship, support, or simply a friend to share your adventures with, please don't hesitate to reach out on discord. I'm always eager to make new connections and share my journey with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for being a part of my incredible journey!
